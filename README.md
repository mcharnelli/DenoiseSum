# DenoiseSum
Unsupervised Opinion Summarization with Noising and Denoising

## Update May 25, 2020

Due to a server error, most of the files, including the clean version of the code, the synthetic data, and the model checkpoints are deleted.
I was able to at least recover the output summaries and an old version of my code. I will try to reproduce the results and update this repository as soon as possible.
