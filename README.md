# DenoiseSum
Unsupervised Opinion Summarization with Noising and Denoising

## Update July 3, 2020

I tried cleaning the code and it is currently uploaded in this repository.
However, since I am currently on internship, I have not tried running the code yet, so it may contain errors.
Consequently, I still don't have model checkpoints that I can share.


## Update May 25, 2020

Due to a server error, most of the files, including the clean version of the code, the synthetic data, and the model checkpoints are deleted.
I was able to at least recover the output summaries and an old version of my code. I will try to reproduce the results and update this repository as soon as possible.
